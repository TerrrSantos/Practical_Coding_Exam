# Practical Coding Exam - Questronix
by: Chester Santos

I've watched different concepts and tutorials about the API, JavaScript, NodeJS, MySQL because I am new to the them. At first, I had a hard time understanding but after watching and reading I have able to understand little by little and practicing it at the same time for better learning. Unfortunately, I am unable to do the said and required task. I know that I have a lot to learn before being able to execute the tasks assigned, and I am willing to commit myself into learning more. Thank you!
